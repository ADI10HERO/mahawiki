# Mahawiki-Restaurant-Project
A web based project I undertook for the purpose of completing the web development challenge.

## Project Documentation
The project is a website created for an abstract restaurant. I designed the site structure such that there is a home page an about us page and a contact us page. I had plans for adding a full menu page but I am pushing that to the next update.

The project runs on node lite server and I have installed a couple of extra libraries such as bootstrap, font-awesome and a few others. I did not upload the node modules as they are best installed after downloading the repository. 

There is a simple and neat form for contacting the restaurant designed by me along with a modal for reserving a table in the restaurant. The website is designed with a mobile first perspective.

### Why I used a Front-End Web UI Frameworks
* Responsive web design – Mobile first
* Cross-browser	compatibility – Dealing with quirks	of browsers
* Increased	productivity – Easy to get started
* Community	support – Resources	and	web	page templates

### Installation
At the command prompt in your git folder, type
    
    npm init
    
Install an NPM module, lite-server, that allows you to run a Node.js based development web server and serve up your project files. To do this, type the following at the prompt
    
    npm install lite-server --save-dev

Next, start the development server by typing the following at the prompt.

    npm start

You will use npm to fetch the Bootstrap files for use within your project. Thereafter you need to install JQuery and Popper.js as shown below since Bootstrap 4 depends on these two. At the prompt, type the following to fetch Bootstrap files to your project folder.

    npm install bootstrap@4.0.0 --save
    npm install jquery@3.3.1 popper.js@1.12.9 --save

Note: In case the server gives any errors copy the package.json from my repository back again.
