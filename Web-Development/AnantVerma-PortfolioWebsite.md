<h1>Mahawiki Web Development Project</h1>
<p> A web dev project I undertook to complete Mahawiki Phase 2 challenge. </p>
<p> Check out the final project at http://infiniteverma.github.io</p>
<h2> Project Documentation </h2>
<p> This was a simple project with only one page having a header, 4 sections and then a footer. There were inline links and each section was assigned a div and given different properties except the height.</p>
