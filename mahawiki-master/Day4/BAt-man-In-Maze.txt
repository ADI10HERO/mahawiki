Batman is running behind Joker for sending him Acids. 
Now since Joker knows all the paths of his locality, 
he guides Batman into a MAZE (n x n). 
Batman is standing in top row of MAZE exactly in center cell i.e n is odd and 
Batman is on (n+1)/2 th cell . Batman is a comprehensive thinker 
he wants to know that how many ways are possible so as to reach the bottom 
most row by taking "A Down Step" followed by either a "Left Step" OR a "Right Step" 
to make it a move. A series of such moves leading to the bottommost row makes it a way. 
Given number of testcases and each testcase has an Odd Integer give the number of 
ways to reach bottommost row as output.

Constraints-
T < 30
3<=n<=60
n is an odd integer.

Sample Example :-
n = 3 

_ * _
_ _ _
_ _ _

Possible steps are :-
DL-DR , DR-DL

OUTPUT = 2
