# The Python Challenge 
## The goal of this phase is to make you get started with open source if you haven't started yet! 

### >  Problem Statements:

#### 1. There is an array with every element repeated twice except one. Write a function to find that element.
         For example, if given array is [1,1,2,2,3,4,4,5,5] then your program should return 3

#### 2. Write a function to find all pairs in an integer array whose sum is equal to a given number. 

#### 3. Write a function to return most occuring character in a String. 
         For example if input is ‘aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaabbbbcddddeeeeee’ it should return “a”.
```diff
- All codes that you submit, or modify will be considered only if they are working only.
- Coding to be done only in Python
```

### If your gets accepted, you'll get points! If you modify someone's code to optimise it, you'll get points.
Here is the pointing scheme. 
1. You submit your code which is atleast syntactically error free, you earn 5 points
     Here, we look at your Logic mainly! 
2. We will have all of them doing the same. You'll get a time of almost 48 hours after the upload of all codes on GitHub. 
You make changes to others code on our main repository to optimise it and make a pull request and get it accepted, you earn 2 points. 
3. For explanation through suitable comments you earn 2 points
4. For early commit, you earn 1 point.
